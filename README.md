# Tanner the Scanner

**Note: Development for Tanner the Scanner has been paused indefinitely.**

Tanner the Scanner was one of the first apps from ES Development. It was originally created as a test, and was eventually published to satisfy customer requests. 

Soon after being published, Apple embedded a QR function in the default iOS camera app, which essentially removed the market for third-party QR apps. We greatly appreciate everyone who previosuly used Tanner the Scanner, and those who still use Tanner the Scanner on a daily basis.
